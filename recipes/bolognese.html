    <h2>Recipe passed on from my Italian grandfather. The ultimate comfort food. Leftovers freeze nicely!</h2>
    <p>
        To make this recipe more authentic, you can use a mixture of ground veal, pork, and beef. 
        You can also substitute the balsamic vinegar for 1/2 cup of red wine.

    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a rolling boil. Cook the 
            spaghetti in the boiling water until cooked through yet firm to the bite,
            about 12 minutes; drain.
        </li>
        <li>
            Heat the olive oil in a large pot over medium heat. Cook the bacon in the oil until crisp,
            8 to 10 minutes. Stir the onion, celery, carrot, and oregano into the bacon; continue cooking
            until the vegetables begin to soften, another 8 to 10 minutes. Add the garlic and cook until
            fragrant, about 2 minutes. Crumble the ground beef into the vegetable mixture; cook and stir
            until the beef is completely cooked and no longer pink, 8 to 10 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>
            Pour the balsamic vinegar over the ground beef mixture; allow to simmer until the liquid evaporates,
            about 5 minutes. Stir the crushed tomatoes, tomato paste, and sugar into the ground beef mixture;
            bring the mixture to a boil, season with salt and black pepper, and remove from heat. 
            Stir the fresh basil into the mixture.
        </li>
        <li>
            Ladle the sauce over the cooked spaghetti. Top with Parmesan cheese to serve.
        </li>
    </ol>
