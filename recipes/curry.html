    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Murgh Kari makes use of a potent spice blend that includes garam masala, coriander, turmeric, and cayenne pepper.</li>
        <li>Tomato, yogurt, and onion are also essential ingredients in this classic Indian main dish.</li>
        <li>Fresh minced garlic and ginger lend a pleasant sharpness.</li>
        <li>Our top-rated recipe uses skinless, boneless chicken breasts for a tender, evenly cooked result, but other cuts like tenderloin and thigh make suitable substitutions.</li> 
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Start by partially cooking your seasoned chicken breasts in a large pan, 
            removing them after they're browned.
        </li>
        <li>
            After setting the chicken breasts aside, cook garlic, onions, and ginger
            in the same pan to create the flavor base.
        </li>
        <li>
            Once the onions are translucent, add in spices, tomatoes, yogurt, and chicken to cook thoroughly.
        </li>
        <li>
            Cover and simmer for about 20 minutes for a wow-worthy chicken curry. 
            Finish with fresh herbs and a squeeze of lemon.
        </li>
    </ol>
