Odin recipes website

This is a practice project following TOP's curriculum. In this project I will create a website listing different cooking recipes, practicing creating html content and eventually styling it with CSS.

This is also practice at creating, cloning repositories and working at making short, concise and meaningful commit messages to document the progress of a project.
